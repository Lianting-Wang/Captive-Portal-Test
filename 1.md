### Guide for Completing the TCP Server and Client Assignment

This guide will walk you through completing the TCP server and client applications using Python. You'll learn about network programming fundamentals, focusing on socket operations and JSON data handling.

#### Part 1: Understanding Sockets

Sockets are endpoints for sending and receiving data between two devices on a network. In Python, you use the `socket` module to create and manage socket connections.

**Key Socket Operations:**
1. **Creating a Socket**:
   ```python
   import socket
   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   ```
   - `AF_INET` specifies the IPv4 address family.
   - `SOCK_STREAM` signifies a TCP connection.

2. **Binding a Socket**:
   To accept connections, a server socket must be bound to an IP address and a port number.
   ```python
   s.bind((host, port))
   ```
   - `host`: Server's hostname or IP address.
   - `port`: Port number for the server.

3. **Listening for Incoming Connections**:
   After binding, the server should listen for incoming connections.
   ```python
   s.listen()
   ```
   - This method prepares the server to accept connection requests.

4. **Accepting Connections**:
   When a client attempts to connect, the server accepts the connection.
   ```python
   conn, addr = s.accept()
   ```
   - `conn`: A new socket object to communicate with the client.
   - `addr`: Address of the client.

5. **Sending and Receiving Data**:
   - **Server Sending Data**:
     ```python
     conn.sendall(data.encode())
     ```
   - **Client Receiving Data**:
     ```python
     data = conn.recv(1024).decode()
     ```
   - Data is sent and received as bytes, hence the use of `encode()` and `decode()`.

6. **Closing the Socket**:
   Always close the socket when done.
   ```python
   s.close()
   ```

#### Part 2: Working with JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for data interchange. It's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

**Using JSON in Python**:
1. **Importing JSON Module**:
   ```python
   import json
   ```
2. **Serializing (Encoding) JSON**:
   Convert a Python object into a JSON string.
   ```python
   json_string = json.dumps({'key': 'value'})
   ```
3. **Deserializing (Decoding) JSON**:
   Parse a JSON string into a Python object.
   ```python
   obj = json.loads(json_string)
   ```

**Example**: Sending and receiving JSON over a socket.
- **Sending JSON**:
  ```python
  request = json.dumps({'command': 'getHost'})
  conn.sendall(request.encode())
  ```
- **Receiving JSON**:
  ```python
  response = json.loads(conn.recv(1024).decode())
  ```

#### Part 3: Completing the Start Code

Now, use what you've learned to complete the server and client applications. Here are the steps you'll follow:

1. **Implement the missing methods in the `Server` class**:
   - Set up the server to accept multiple client connections.
   - Handle each client in a separate thread.
   - Process incoming requests and respond appropriately.

2. **Complete the `TCPClient` class methods**:
   - Implement methods to send various commands to the server.
   - Handle server responses and display results or take actions based on the response.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test your server and client by running them on your local machine or across multiple machines.
   - Ensure your client can connect, send commands, and receive responses from the server.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Use logging to help you trace and debug your application.

#### Final Tips

- Pay close attention to error handling. Network programs must handle various exceptions like connection errors, data transmission errors, and more.
- Keep your code modular and organized to make debugging and testing easier.
- Comment your code to explain why you're doing something, not what you're doing.

By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of network programming, sockets, and JSON, all of which are valuable skills in many programming and IT fields.
